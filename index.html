    <h2>awakened child</h2>
    <p>Awakening is based on Swami Vivekananda’s idea of the goal of education- ‘We want that education by which character is formed, strength of mind is increased, the intellect is expanded, and by which one can stand by one’s own feet.’</p>
<p>It aims to prepare young minds to adopt certain noble values in their lives voluntarily and thereby respond to life’s challenges better. Awakening empowers a child to develop self-belief, self-reliance, self-control and good character. Unless these traits are well developed, mere book-learning can cause more harm than good. Every child has these qualities in a ‘seed’ form and gardeners, in the form of trained facilitators and parents can lovingly enable the seed to sprout, take root and grow into a powerful tree of loving and harmonious human being.</p>

            <p>Awakening was envisioned by a senior monk of Ramakrishna Mission, Delhi, and subsequently developed by a team consisting of qualified resource persons from Ramakrishna Mission, Delhi, child psychologists, program developers and story writers. The program content and the delivery tools were researched, packaged and integrated with the help of domain experts and with ELF Learning Solutions, Chennai, the Knowledge Partner of the AWAKENING Program.</p>
            <p>After a considerable amount of research, stakeholder consultation and piloting, “Awakening” has been developed to bring out the very best in young children, without any compulsion or prejudice.</p>

          <div class="card-body">
            <p>Awakening consists of a mix of age-appropriate stories and fun activities that introduce and reinforce certain noble values for children. Thus, when children listen to the stories, participate vigorously in the discussions in the presence of a trained facilitator, and then carry out activities both at school and at home, these life- transforming values get permanently embedded in their hearts. Young children learn to understand the consequences of their actions and understand why and how they can choose what is best for them and for society. Parental engagements will create an overall enabling environment for the holistic development of a child. Surveys and scientific tools will help to understand the impact of the program.</p>

      <div class="card-body">
        <p>Schools that register for Awakening will need to nominate primary school teachers to attend a half-a–day Facilitator’s Training Workshop. The dates for training workshops will be intimated to schools in advance. After training, each school will be provided two set of kits (in English or Hindi depending on need).</p>
        <p>Enrolled Schools will need to allot 20 periods of 40-45 minutes each in the time table for each class (1 to 5). For a value to be understood through a story and related activities, 5 periods of 40-45 minutes each, are required. Hence for 4 values, a total of 20 periods per class is required.</p>
        <p>While the maximum impact will be felt by a child who starts the program in Class 1 and continues till Class 5, Awakening is designed in such a way that children will benefit even if they have one year’s exposure. Hence, any school which registers may run the program simultaneously for all the 5 classes (1 to 5). Awakening will be initially available in Hindi and English.</p>
        <p>Ramakrishna Mission Resource persons will provide training and continuous support to the school to conduct the program.  Schools are requested to extend cooperation to conduct the assessment survey for the program from time to time. Since parental engagement is a significant aspect of the program, parental support and involvement is solicited.</p>
